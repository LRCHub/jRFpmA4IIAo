My path has flipped man like in a handstand
Calendar's faster than any athlete on the tracks can be
Record on the dash cam back hand
Put the villains in the trash can
Jesus I'm praising You
Try to sing songs like the angels do
Putting all I got and my faith in You
Calling on Your name cause You claim the truth
You gave me the boots changed my mood
To back away from the devil cause he's dangerous
He put the blame on us but he lost to the King of kings who came to save us!
Herano mecha shea ne la chana means The King is coming and we all will see Him!
Herano mena Yeshua means The King I mean is Yeshua
Herano mecha shea ne la chana means The King is coming and we all will see Him!
Mashanda rua la cham means With an angel army in the clouds!
The pope is a rockstar I want you to know
No one is above and no one's below
We are all the same in front of the throne
Belonging to the King of the heavenly dome
Which is Jesus Christ!
The way the truth and the life!
Maybe I'm hard on myself but I feel like a loser
Cause I used to chose women and booze
Weed abuse snooze fleeing the truth
Thank God that I grew to big for these shoes
I dream about freaking living my life
In a way that I just don't care
About death stares I'm going to get
For the stories I'm about to share
I ain't scared Lord you fight by my side
And nobody can consider to dare
To be going at You because You throwing the truth
Like a backhand slap on the head
My Lord is immaculate
And He came with a promise that I had to get
Fact checked my act checked
Get rid of all the weight that got my back wrecked
The past gets us and never lets us run free from this prison listen
I was caught in chains but was freed by the Blood of Jesus!
Every knee will bow to the King of kings!
Every knee will bow to the King of kings!
Every knee will bow to the King of kings!
Every knee will bow to the King of kings!
The pope is a rockstar I want you to know
No one is above and no one's below
We are all the same in front of the throne
Belonging to the King of the heavenly dome
Which is Jesus Christ!
The way the truth and the life!
Herano mecha shea ne la chana means The King is coming and we all will see Him!
Herano mena Yeshua means The King I mean is Yeshua
Herano mecha shea ne la chana means The King is coming and we all will see Him!
Mashanda rua la cham means With an angel army in the clouds!
